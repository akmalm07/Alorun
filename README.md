# Alorun

A minimal Expo hello-world app for Android.

## Run on a Pixel

1. Install Node.js and pnpm 11, then run `pnpm install` in this directory.
2. Install Expo Go from Google Play on your Pixel.
3. Connect your computer and phone to the same Wi-Fi network and run `pnpm start`.
4. Scan the QR code with your phone's camera and open the link in Expo Go. If LAN access fails, try `pnpm exec expo start --tunnel` (this may require Expo's tunnel package and network access).

Expo Go runs the app directly on your phone; it is not an Android emulator. Its installed version must support the app's Expo SDK.

## Run in an Android emulator

Install Android Studio, the Android SDK and an Android Virtual Device through Device Manager. Start the virtual device, then run `pnpm android`. An emulator runs on the computer, not on the Pixel.
